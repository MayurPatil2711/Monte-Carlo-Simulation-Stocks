# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Stocks
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for Monte Carlo Simulations performed to predict the stock prices for three different companies: ONGC, GAIL, NTPC. Also, linear regression model has been build to predict new stock prices.
## What is Monte Carlo Method?
Monte-Carlo method is a mathematical method to estimate all the possible outcomes of an uncertain event with a large number of variables. This method was invented by John Von Neumann(The main man behind the invention of modern computer architecture) and Stanislaw Ulam during the period of world-war II and their main motivation of working on this method was to make quick and nearly accurate decisions in an uncertain event. The meaning behind the name of this method is quite interesting as it is directly derived from the casino town of Monaco, Monte-Carlo, the reason for this peculiar name is that the main approach while using this method is quite similar to the game of roulette famous in the casinos of Monte-Carlo.
## Application of Monte Carlo Simulations:
Monte-Carlo has a very wide range of applications, its main applications are prediction of stock prices, sales forecasting, possible risks of artificial intelligence in future etc. There are several forms of Monte-Carlo methods which are actively used in the field of Soft-condensed matter Physics and Materials Science, a modified version of Monte-Carlo method known as Quantum Monte-Carlo has been an alternative to traditional ab-initio simulations such as Density functional theory calculations, the main motive behind the usage of Quantum Monte-Carlo is to calculate some essential electronic properties of materials. When we look at a material at a nano-scale it is observed that there is aggregation of atoms into molecules which is direct consequence of the motion of electrons and this results in changes in the electronic properties of the material, and with the help of Quantum Monte-Carlo we can accurately predict the “exchange-correlation functional for the homogeneous electron gas as a function of density”. 
Another frequently used version of the Monte-Carlo method is the Kinetic Monte-Carlo method. This method is used to sample the equilibrium distribution of different thermodynamic systems as efficiently as possible or in other words create an NVT or NPT ensemble which is widely used in defining environment conditions in molecular simulations of protein interactions with biomaterials.
